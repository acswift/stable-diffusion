8N or 8S?

adetailer will not clear empty fields from previous settings

can I use a space or a . in the empty field to do this?

the masculine negative prompt did a job on the face!

the results without the upscaler are not the same as with — I'm not sure how to 

————————————————————————————————————————

adding . to the negative AD prompt DELETED the main negative prompt, which would have been en jeu

I have confirmed by copying the main negative prompt to the AD negative prompt that if the AD negative prompt is empty, it will use the main negative prompt

AND using . in the negative prompt had a better result

does 128px need to be changed to 64px for non-upscaled images?
also blur & x-offset etc.

———————————————————————————————————————— x offset

just moves the image by the specified amount — no surprise

———————————————————————————————————————— dilation vs padding

it LOOKS like dilation increases the head size, so need to use padding to counter
or remove dilation altogether?

———————————————————————————————————————— 

now testing by reducing blur from 32 to 16 and removing 32px x-offset

will then test with much less dilation

———————————————————————————————————————— problem was lora

lora ineffective when there's nothing around it — need margin to function

same thing without lora — face is much nicer when dilated by 128px, but background doesn't match

I cannot find an official explanation of padding, but it seems to do with integrating the background into the new image

from reddit: Make sure you experiment with the Padding option. Increasing padding will add surrounding context and it's a lot easier to see it in action with previews enabled.

Inpaint only masked padding to 96 so the face matches the original image better.

Increase the mask padding, so more of the image is considered and doesn't confuse feet with hand.

First I'd try bumping up pixel padding from 32 to 64.
